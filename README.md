# Information-Retrieval

Final group project for the exam Information Retrieval offered by the University of Padua, done by me and 5 more people.
The aim of the project was to build probabilistic click models that can be used to simulate userâ€™s behaviour on a search engine result page. A total of 8 different click models have been tested.
